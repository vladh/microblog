So far, I've only really posted infrequent manicured content on my
[website](https://vladh.net) so I thought it would be nice to have a place to
more regularly share random things as I work on them, even if this means having
small silly posts. To avoid things getting lost in the noise, if a microblog
post ends up being particularly good, I'll promote it to a full website post.

People I follow like [Drew
DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/2022/07/18/Status-update-July-2022.html)
and [100
rabbits](https://drewdevault.com/2022/07/18/Status-update-July-2022.html)
have monthly "status updates", but my updates currently aren't organised
enough for something like this.

One person I know who does something similar is [Bill
Wurtz](https://billwurtz.com/expert.html) with his "expert mode". You'd think
nobody would bother to look through an HTML document with a million tiny posts,
but I've thoroughly enjoyed looking at everthing Bill has done, even the
random everyday bits.

I know this is what people normally use social media for, but the last thing
I want to do is host everything I write on the website of a corporation that
monetises outrage and bickering. There's the Fediverse, but self-hosting
feels nice.

Unlike content for my [website](https://vladh.net) or [clumsy
computer](https://vladh.net/clumsycomputer), the stuff on the microblog isn't
well-suited for teaching, and I don't go out of my way to explain things so
beginners can understand them. Honestly, I'll probably post about things _I_
don't understand very well.

Overall, I'll share things that brought me joy and helped me learn, whether
related to programming or otherwise. Thanks for coming along on the ride. :)
