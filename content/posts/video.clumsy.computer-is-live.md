As you may know, I create educational programming videos under the name
[clumsy computer](https://vladh.net/clumsycomputer) where I show how to program
everyday tools such as a regular expression engine from scratch without using
any libraries.

So far, the videos have been hosted on YouTube. That's fine, and virtually
every single viewer has discovered the channel there. However, I
([and others](https://drewdevault.com/2022/03/29/free-software-free-infrastructure.html))
have spoken about how it's important for programmers to make sure their work is
available without depending on ethically dubious companies such as Microsoft and
Google. I don't like knowing that the only reason my educational videos can be
hosted for free is that the costs are subsidised by advertising revenue.

I'm therefore happy to announce
[video.clumsy.computer](https://video.clumsy.computer), which is a
[PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) instance hosted by me where all the
educational videos I make will also be available from now on. Not only does this
mean that all of my work will be hosted under my own terms, but PeerTube also
supports [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/), which means that all users
of either another PeerTube or [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance can
interact with everything hosted on the website. Confused by all the terms? It
basically means this website is compatible with other people's self-hosted
social networks and video websites.

It feels a lot more cosy for clumsy computer to have its own home, and I also
look forward to uploading any non-clumsy-computer videos I create in the future.

In line with this change, I've also moved the primary home of all of the code
from GitHub to a [sourcehut
repository](https://git.sr.ht/~vladh/clumsycomputer).

The eagle-eyed among you may notice that, while this is great, I haven't
actually been making many videos lately, since the last video was published more
than a year ago. Perhaps you should be looking out for more news in the near
future! :)

As I always say at the end of clumsy computer videos, see you soon and have fun
programming!
